In summary, commits are essential for maintaining project integrity, enabling collaboration, and tracking the development process.

## How does branching work in Git, and why is it an important feature for collaborative development on GitHub? Discuss the process of creating, using, and merging branches in a typical workflow.
**Branching in Git:**

Branching allows you to work on separate lines of development without affecting the main codebase. It’s crucial for collaboration because it enables parallel development, isolates changes, and allows safe experimentation.

**Key Steps:**

1. **Create a Branch:**  
   - `git checkout -b <branch-name>` to create and switch to a new branch.

2. **Work on the Branch:**  
   - Make changes and commit them independently of the main branch.

3. **Merge the Branch:**  
   - Switch to the main branch (`git checkout main`) and merge with `git merge <branch-name>`.

4. **Clean Up:**  
   - Delete the branch after merging with `git branch -d <branch-name>`.

**Why It’s Important:**
Branching keeps the main code stable while allowing multiple developers to work independently, making it easier to manage and merge features or fixes.

## Explore the role of pull requests in the GitHub workflow. How do they facilitate code review and collaboration, and what are the typical steps involved in creating and merging a pull request?
**Role of Pull Requests in GitHub Workflow:**
